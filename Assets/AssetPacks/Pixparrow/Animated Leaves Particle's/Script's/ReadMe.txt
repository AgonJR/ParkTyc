To use the 3D Lod system in the vfx graph, attach the VfxSetPosition script to a Gameobject and drop all the vfx graphs into the script.
Or set the graphs position manually.

Note*
You can use the custom mesh in particle system but its not really efficient and its heavy on the Cpu, The vfx graph uses the Gpu instead and it's way much better.
